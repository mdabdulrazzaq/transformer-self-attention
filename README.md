# Self-Attention in Transformers: Concepts and Implementation

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of self-attention in transformers, a crucial mechanism in modern natural language processing models. The project demonstrates how self-attention works step-by-step using Python code, along with practical explanations and real-world applications.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Sentence Representation**:
   - How sentences are represented as matrices of word embeddings.

2. **Scores Matrix**:
   - Computing the similarity between words using the dot product of embeddings.

3. **Softmax and Attention Weights**:
   - Transforming scores into probabilities using the softmax function.

4. **Context-Aware Embeddings**:
   - Generating embeddings that incorporate the context of the entire sentence.

5. **Real-World Applications**:
   - Scalability of self-attention in handling large-scale text processing tasks, such as:
     - Language modeling (e.g., GPT, BERT).
     - Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate).
     - Summarization and more.

## How It Works

### 1. **Sentence Representation**:
Each word in a sentence is represented as a vector in an embedding space. For example:

```python
X = np.array([
    [0.5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.6],  # Embedding for "I"
    [0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.3],  # Embedding for "love"
    [0.4, 0.6, 0.3, 0.8]   # Embedding for "bears"
])
```

### 2. **Compute Scores Matrix**:
Measure the similarity between words using:

```python
scores = np.dot(X, X.T)
```

### 3. **Apply Softmax**:
Transform scores into probabilities:

```python
def softmax(matrix):
    exp_matrix = np.exp(matrix)
    return exp_matrix / exp_matrix.sum(axis=0, keepdims=True)

attention_weights = softmax(scores)
```

### 4. **Generate Context-Aware Embeddings**:
Combine information from all words:

```python
new_embeddings = np.zeros_like(X)
for i in range(X.shape[0]):
    new_embeddings[i] = (
        attention_weights[0, i] * X[0] +
        attention_weights[1, i] * X[1] +
        attention_weights[2, i] * X[2]
    )
```

## Real-World Applications

In practice, transformers scale this mechanism to process vast amounts of text efficiently. Applications include:

- **Language Models**: Generating text (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- **Translation**: Mapping text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).
- **Summarization**: Condensing lengthy documents.
